<h1><b> 2023 Travelers Analytics Case Competition - InsNova Auto Insurance </b></h1>


<h2><b> Project Overview</b></h2>
<p>In the 2023 Travelers Analytics Case Competition, our team developed a predictive model for InsNova Auto Insurance, an Australian company. We were tasked with creating a rating plan based on historical auto claim data to improve segmentation and maintain competitiveness in the market.</p>

<h2><b>Objective</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Develop a predictive model for auto insurance claim costs.</li>
  <li>Enhance segmentation and competitiveness in the market.</li>
  <li>Convince business partners of the model's efficacy, despite their limited statistics knowledge</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Modeling Approach</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Limited to group collaboration; independent of other groups.</li>
  <li>Predicted claim cost for validation data and submitted in the specified CSV format.</li>
  <li>Prepared a concise presentation summarizing our findings.</li>
  
</ul>

<h2><b>Benchmark</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Our model's performance was benchmarked against a LightGBM model.</li>
  <li>Focused on surpassing the provided Gini index reference</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Key Challenges</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Translating complex statistical concepts for a non-statistical audience.</li>
  <li>Balancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model.</li>
  <li>Competing with other market players using a robust predictive model.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Results and Business Impact</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a model that improved upon the benchmark Gini index.</li>
  <li>Provided a clear and understandable presentation of our methods and findings to our business partner.</li>
  <li>Enhanced the company's ability to segment risks and price policies more competitively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Importance of clear communication in a technical context.</li>
  <li>The value of iterative modeling and frequent validation.</li>
  <li>Navigating competitive market dynamics with data-driven strategies.</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Future Work</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Explore further enhancements in predictive modeling techniques.</li>
  <li>Consider external factors such as economic conditions in future models.</li>
</ul>
